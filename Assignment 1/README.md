# CSE306


-- In this assignment, we implemented a raytracer from scratch with the following features : 
- Diffuse and mirror surfaces (Lab 1 / pages 17--25 of the lecture notes)
- Direct lighting and shadows, for point light sources (Lab 1  / pages 13-19)
- Indirect lighting for point light sources (Lab 2 / pages 25--31) without Russian roulette 
- Antialiasing (Lab 2 / pages 33-34) 
- Ray mesh intersection (Lab 3 / pages 42-44) including BVH (Lab 4 / pages 45--47). 


The code is located in raytracer.cpp and can be run with the following command : 
g++ raytracer.cpp -O3
time ./a.out
